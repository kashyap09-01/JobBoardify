# JobBoardify

JobBoardify is a user-friendly job portal website for employers and job seekers. Developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL, it offers a streamlined platform for job posting and searching, as well as easy-to-use features such as candidate application tracking and a contact page for employer inquiries.

This Job Portal Website is designed for both employers and job seekers. The website features an intuitive Admin Dashboard where registered employers can post job openings, manage previously posted jobs, and view a table of candidates who have applied for these jobs. The Dashboard also includes a Contact Page, which provides information about the website's creator and how to get in touch.

Job seekers can browse the website's Job Portal Interface without needing to register or login. They can view job details and click on the "Apply Now" button to submit their application. All the details related to the candidates who applied for the job are reflected in the Candidates Applied Page of the Admin Dashboard.

To get started with this project, employers need to register themselves and log in to the Admin Dashboard. From there, they can add new job postings, manage the existing ones, and track the candidate applications. Job seekers can visit the Job Portal Interface to search and apply for job openings easily. This website serves as a platform that connects job seekers and employers in a streamlined manner.
